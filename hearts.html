<p>What this website's all about and how to use it</a>
<p>K-2.DA.9
Identify and describe patterns in data visualizations, such as charts or graphs, to make predictions.
Data can be used to make inferences or predictions about the world.
</p>
<p>For example, students could record the number of each color of candy in a small packet. Then, they compare their individual data with classmates. Students could use the collected data to predict how many of each colored candy will be in a full size bag of like candy. (CA CCSS for Mathematics K.MD.3, 1.MD.4, 2.MD.10)</p>

<p>Alternatively, students could sort and classify objects according to their properties and note observations. Students could then create a graph or chart of their observations and look for connections/relationships (e.g., items that are hard are usually also smooth, or items that are fluffy are usually also light in weight.) Students then look at pictures of additional objects and make predictions regarding the properties of the objects pictured. (CA NGSS: 2-PS1-1, 2-PS1-2)</p>
